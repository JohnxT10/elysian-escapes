![CSS Warnings](assets/screenshots/css-warnings.png)  
*Some warnings were reported during CSS validation. Many of these, such as those generated by Autoprefixer, can be safely ignored as they are necessary for cross-browser compatibility. Other warnings, like "background-color and border-color are the same," are intentional design choices to maintain the luxury aesthetic of the website and can also be disregarded.*
