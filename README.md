## Reflections on AI Use

### Key Decisions & Outcomes
AI was used to generate HTML/CSS structures, suggest Bootstrap utility classes, and recommend layout improvements. This led to a more consistent and visually appealing design, with efficient implementation of responsive features and interactive elements.

### Bug Identification & Resolution
AI played a role in quickly identifying and resolving layout and styling bugs, such as card alignment and button positioning. Suggestions for Bootstrap class usage and CSS adjustments resulted in faster debugging and a smoother user experience.

### Performance & UX Improvements
AI contributed to performance and UX by recommending best practices for responsive design, semantic HTML, and accessibility. This ensured the site loads efficiently and provides a seamless experience across devices.

### Workflow & Efficiency
AI support streamlined the workflow by providing instant code suggestions, troubleshooting, and design ideas. This improved development speed and allowed for rapid iteration, resulting in a polished final product with minimal manual trial-and-error.

## Testing

### HTML Testing
![HTML Testing](assets/screenshots/testing.md/html-testing.png)  
*The HTML testing report confirms that there were no errors or warnings detected across all pages of the website. This ensures that the markup is valid, standards-compliant, and contributes to reliable rendering and accessibility on all modern browsers.*

### CSS Testing

![CSS Autoprefixer](assets/screenshots/testing.md/css-autoprefixer.png)  
*The CSS Autoprefixer tool was used to automatically add vendor prefixes to the CSS code. This ensures that the latest CSS features are compatible and function correctly across all major browsers, providing a consistent user experience.*

*After processing the styles with Autoprefixer, the CSS was tested using a validation tool. No errors were found, confirming that the code is standards-compliant and robust across different environments.*

![CSS Warnings](assets/screenshots/testing.md/css-warnings.png)  
*Some warnings were reported during CSS validation. Many of these, such as those generated by Autoprefixer, can be safely ignored as they are necessary for cross-browser compatibility. Other warnings, like "background-color and border-color are the same," are intentional design choices to maintain the luxury aesthetic of the website and can also be disregarded.*
